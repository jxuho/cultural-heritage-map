// Process the Promise returned by fn(req, res, next), 
// If an error occurs through .catch(next), the next() function is called and the error is passed to the middleware chain. 
// Wrapping with Promise.resolve() converts fn to a Promise even if it is a synchronous function that does not return a Promise. 
// This is a safety feature that allows you to use .catch(). 
// (But this is not required, since controller functions usually always return a Promise due to the async keyword.)
